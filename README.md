##  Blockchain

A blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data 

Following functionality has been implemented in the blockchain

1: Chain of Data

2: Mine a new Block

3: Block Hashing

4: Analyze & verify the chain

5: Real Transction

6: Store chain to Disk

7: Node Network

8: Share Data, Restore conflicts

9: Wallets
